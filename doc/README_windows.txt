MicroVisionChain
=====================

Intro
-----
MicroVisionChain is an implementation of a node for the MicroVisionChain network and is one of the pieces of software that provide
the backbone of the network. It downloads and stores the entire history of MicroVisionChain transactions (which is currently
several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take
anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run mvcd.exe.
